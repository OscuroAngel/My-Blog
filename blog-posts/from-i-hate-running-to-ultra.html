  <h2 class="blog-title">From “I Hate Running” to UltraMarathon</h2>

  <p class="post">
    I bet you have said “I hate running” many times in your life. Everyone did.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Except maybe few crazy ones but let's not talk about those exceptions.
  </p>

    “Lifting weights faster is my Cardio” used to be my mojo when I just started gym. How the hell I ended up
    running Ultra….? I have no idea. But I will tell you my whole story of getting into this sport, in some other
    post. Now I will try to show you how I've been taking running wrong my whole life.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    During my childhood, I remember we were running around the river in my city with gymnastic team. Don't remember
    much about it, yet the little memories I have are anything but fun. Same would be any other time I would try doing
    this for what ever reason. (Once It was the 3k charity race that I though I will fall dead…good old times…)
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    So what was the moment of the change?
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Guess it happened gradually. From improving my general fitness, it became something else. The time during my
    (at the beginning mostly) evening runs, turn into time for me and myself. I would listen to my favorite music.
    Enjoying the views and the calmness of the late evenings. Think about something positive and relax my mind from
    the difficult day.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Kind of an active meditation.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    All of this of course when I learn not to look every other second on my phone app I used back then, to see how
    many meters I run by now and how many more I have to go.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    This bad habit by itself was a #1 killer of the joy to run.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    As soon as I learn not to think but just to enjoy the moment, I could run more and more far every time. And when
    you see the progress, it motivates you to stick with routine. Specially as you achieve something you could
    not do before.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    I still remember the excitement when I run for the first time 10 kilometer distance. I was so happy to achieve
    it. Something I though I still have long way to go.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Then I thought, “So now that I did 10k… 15k is not so far”.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Then I did 15…. And then i suddenly did 21k….. and between 10 and 21 time pass so quickly, and I thought, “so since
    I did 21k already - marathon is very real… and not so impossible, is there is anything after the marathon?”
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    And that was a trap!
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    It happen so fast that I start looking at different mountain races. I was happy to learn that the route I had a
    dream to walk one day, but it needed many days to do so, “Tour du Mont Blanc”, is actually the World Cup of trail
    running! Called UTMB. So there are people that run such distances. And I can run 170 kilometers instead of walking
    them and save some time (if you don't count the time to train and qualify for the race. But that's the details
    I still choose to ignore).
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    For some reason this idea and those people didn't seem crazy to me. It was more like “Wow…how come I didn't knew
    people do that. I can do it too…”
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    The emotions were more of excitement and fascination.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Gradually I became like a junkie for every Ultrarunning video in YouTube. Started looking for some entry level
    races. Looking at the elite athletes of the field. Their videos, reviews and photos from the races. With
    the BIG goal in my mind.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    It consumed my soul I would say.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    And 11th of November, 6am I was standing on the starting line of my first Ultra. Ultra Trail Pelion. With big
    determination to finish the race and enjoy every second of it!
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    But that is another story.
