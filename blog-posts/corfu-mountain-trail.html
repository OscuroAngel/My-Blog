    “Why would anybody want to run for 24 hours?<span style="color: #e85a4f; font-size: larger">”</span> Honestly,
    I still don’t have a clear answer, guess I need to run more Ultras to find that out. What I know is that at
    least up to some kilometres I enjoy being out there so much, that want to move further to see what lies ahead.

    Corfu Mountain Trail was my second ultra-race and so far, my longest. What does help me not to flee at the start,
    is the thought “Today, I will be the whoooole day in nature, at the mountains”. So, guess one of my reasons “Why?”
    is the love of nature.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    I have never been running a road marathon so far. One day, but later. And I have a feeling that it will be a very
    occasional event. Running trails make me connect with nature more than anything else. Help me to experience the
    area to the fullest. It Is not the same to come to a mountain peak by car or come there on foot, especially if the
    latest involves running.
  </p>

    After living on Corfu for 6 years, can say with confidence that in the race, it was the first time I have truly
    seen the island. I knew the island is the greenest in Greece, but couldn’t imagine that it has so many hidden
    treasures. The variety of the trails, the trees, the valleys and the hills. At some point going through the forests,
    you can feel as if you got into a fairyland. Later you get to discover traditional villages of Corfu, with their
    narrow stony streets and local people cheering you and looking with a mix of wonder and admiration.

    During the race, the most struggle for me came in the middle of the night. I was so happy and excited for most of
    the race and even part of the night. But later, the sleep deprivation and the hours on foot made them felt. And it
    was the hours that we teamed up with two other runners to go through the night. I could not wish for better
    company. Don’t want to even think at what dark place of my mind I would be if not for another two lights on
    the trail. When I say that my win is also theirs, I do not underestimate my effort in any case. It’s the least
    I can say to express my gratitude.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    This is something that occupies my mind since the race. Whenever I mentioned the role of others, I get in
    return the encouragement to prize more my effort. Like if by recognizing the contribution of others, I take from
    recognition of my hard work. Why they can’t just co-exist? It is not a pie that if you cut a piece for someone,
    you will get less left for yourself. First of all, you don’t need the whole pie (not that I could not eat it all
    myself, but it's better not to, for many reasons). Second, I think it's “the more you give the more you get” that
    applies here.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Whatever hard work I would put, without the clever training program of my coach with his knowledge and experience,
    I hardly believe I would make the same result. But also, lying on the couch for a year with the best training
    program in the world at your hand, will not make you a runner. Also, even though I could not see my friends at
    the race, I felt their support. This support was moving me forward too. Feeling grateful to share my victory with
    all those people who supported me and been part of this journey, without feeling less strong myself.
