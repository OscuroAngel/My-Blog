    Imaging yourself at the start of a 100 mile race… the heart is rising. Many athletes around you. And in front of
    you are long hours of the trail full of struggle and inner war. If you are not elite and it's your first time on
    this distance, it might take you average of 40 hours to complete the race. During the race you will suffer from
    luck of sleep, energy, mental power and lot of pain. You may fall, you may get lost and eventually stop from racing.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    What are your feelings about how the race will go? Feeling positive that you will finish?
    Don't think so…
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    OR You can imaging the 100miler start with little different mental state. Thinking that you have in front of you 40 hours of adventure and beautiful views of the mountains. So many trails that you have a chance to explore. No thoughts of the distance. Taking it step by step. From one aid station to another. And meanwhile just accepting what ever comes on the way, making the best you can out of it.
    Anxiety will still be there. And the heart will still beat fast awaiting for the signal to start. But how likely you think you will cross the finish line with the second state of mind?
    The body stays the same, it is same you. (Or it is not?)
  </p>

    My mental strategy on long races is simple. “One bite at the time”. On the fist ultra of 80k I was telling to myself “it's just 8 of 10k runs”. 8 is more pretty number to run then 80 right? As soon as one 10k gone…7 left. Then 6 left then 5 left and as soon as the amount of what is left is less then what is already done, you feel that soon it will come to an end. Just little more.
    The aid stations was every 10km which was making it even easier.
    “Let's just get to the next aid station where I will reward you with some chocolate and cookies and then we will see what next” - my dialogue with myself most of the times.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    And it works
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    Shifting our attention from one details to another can make huge difference.
    In first case, only the thought of what follows will make you suffer even before your body will start moving.
    In second case, you can control the suffering and eventually overcome it.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    It is strange how our body responds to self-talk (or self-fooling sometime). It can be hurt and  exhausted at one moment. Then suddenly you feel energy and pain is gone. All you need to do sometime, stop thinking of a pain for just a little while. Concentrate on something else, something more pleasant, like scenery around you, or anything else that bring you some joy will help.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    We all know the power of overthinking. We all did it at some point of our lives.
    You have a problem? Fixate on it so it become huge beast that will eat you from inside. Even if originally it was not that big of a deal.
    Same here and secret is not feeding the “beast”.

    Sports are more then physical training. Specially the discipline of a long distance running.
    As you work on your mental training to keep moving on the trail, the brain then generalizes those skills and can use it anywhere you need them.
    Think about it this way…. Race is just another project or goal. And as you train for the race you also training for achieving the goal.
    Then when facing with project at work, you have more strategies and mental capacity to finish it more efficiently.
    It's like VO2max but the brain.
  </p>
  <p class="post-text">
    So next time you go for your training, wandering why you do it to yourself, think that you are investing not only in your physical fitness but also in your happiness. It's like a safe playground where you are training to react better on any kind of stress and anxiety even outside of a sport.

    Further in my. blog you will find even more about how physical activity is not just about physical  but also about mental health.
